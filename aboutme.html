  <h3>Art</h3>
  <body>
    <p> I enjoy many forms of art such as music, painting, drawing, and graphic design.</p>
<p> One of my favorite activities is painting. I am an avid watercolor artist and I spend a lot of my time at my desk with a pan of paints. It is something I enjoy to do, it relaxes me after stressful days and helps me clear my head. </p>
    <p> I was introduced to the arts at a very young age and I have been drawing since I was young, but I really started to get into it when I was around eleven or twelve. I started out with watercolors and expanded from there. At the moment I most enjoy painting, sketching, sculpting, playing the cello, playing the ukulele, singing, and graphic design.</p>
